Personal Site with portfolio

This site was created to unify my use of semantic HTML and CSS with components of Bootstrap. I created an about me page, with a contact me page and a portfolio to contain future projects. This site is navigable via the bootsrap navbar which is consistent on each page and links to other pages. I additionally used columns and rows through Bootstrap's grid system, and created a user-friendly site that can be read on any device. 

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.
